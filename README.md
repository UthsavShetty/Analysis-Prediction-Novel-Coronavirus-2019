### Visualizing the Coronavirus pandemic with Choropleth-Maps

- A **choropleth map** is a type of thematic map where areas or regions are shaded in proportion to a given data variable.
- **Static choropleth** maps are most useful when you want to compare a desired variable by region. For example, if you wanted to compare     the crime rate of each state in the US at a given moment, you could visualize it with a static choropleth.
**An animated or dynamic choropleth map** is similar to a static choropleth map, except that you can compare a variable by region, over       time. This adds a third dimension of information and is what makes these visualizations so interesting and powerful.

### Dataset
- The data that I used to create the following visualizations is the Novel Corona Virus 2019 dataset from Kaggle, 
  which can be found here - https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset   
  The dataset is a composite of multiple sources including the World Health Organization, National Health Commission of the Peopleâ€™s         Republic of China, and the United States Centers for Disease Control.
  
  
### Static Choropleth
Below is a static choropleth of the total number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus by country as of March 28, 2020. You can see that the countries with the leading number of cases include the US, China, and Italy, along with a couple of other European countries.
